# David Mallard Version 0

This is the WordPress theme I began developing when I set up my personal website at https://davidmallard.id.au

It did enough to provide the basic display while the site was largely unused, and while I wasn't in a position to complete work on a well-designed theme.

Given the advances in WordPress features, web standards and development tools since between implementing the makeshift theme and commencing a full design process, I'm designating this theme as Version 0 for my site and this repository won't undergo any further development.

## Changelog

* Renamed the theme and updated the documentation to indicate that its use and development has been discontinued.

* Updated third-party libraries and assets - Normalize.css to 3.0.2, Modernizr to 2.8.3 and Genericons to 3.2.

### 0.2.0
